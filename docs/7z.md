# 7z

### File structure consistency

`7z a destination.zip "Test/test.txt"` will create an archive while maintaining the relative file structure. The archive's structure will look like:

Test
|---test.txt

. in path:

`7z a destination.zip ./Test/test.txt` will create an archive without maintaining the relative file structure:

test.txt

.. in  path:
` 7z a destination.zip ../t-ayousuf/Test/test.txt` will create an archive without maintaining the relative file structure:

test.txt

~ in path:
`7z a destination.zip ~/Test/test.txt` will not preserve the name of the home directory:

test.txt

* in path:
`7z a destination.zip Test/*` will create an archive and preserve the relative structure:

Test/hi.text
Test/test.txt

absolute path:
`7z a destination.zip /home/t-ayousuf/Test/test.txt` will create an archive like:

test.txt
